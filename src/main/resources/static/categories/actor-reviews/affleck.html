        <p class="review">
          A good ol’ boy from Bas-tan. Ben of the Afflecks has been gracing the
          screens for almost 3 decades now. Over that time he’s seen his share
          of fame, pitfalls and scandal. Along the way he’s picked up a couple
          of Oscars and played a variety of memorable characters. We’ll give
          this guy a solid 4.25 out of 5 stars. Not sure we can 5 star his
          latest Batman.
