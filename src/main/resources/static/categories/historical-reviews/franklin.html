        <p class="review">
            A figure who not only revolutionized American history but also modern
            society, Franklin was known for his many inventions such as the
            lightning rod, bifocals, and the Franklin stove. Additionally, he was
            a successful newspaper editor and printer publishing the Pennsylvania
            Gazette as well as Poor Richard's Almanac. Without Benjamin Franklin's
            contributions, our lives would be profoundly different.
