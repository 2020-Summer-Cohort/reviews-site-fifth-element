        <p class="bio">
          Benjamin Banneker was a free African-American almanac author,
          surveyor, naturalist, and farmer. Born in Baltimore County, Maryland,
          to a free African-American woman and a former slave, Banneker had
          little formal education and was largely self-taught.

        <p class="review">
          With the ability to teach himself with no next to no education is
          nothing short of remarkable. Through an extensive immersion into
          astronomy. Bannaker was able to make calculations that predicted
          eclipses and planetary conjunctions. For a man of color, let alone
          slave ancestry to acquire such ability and execute it makes him a
          highly touted Ben of legend.
